     * Similar to Sims, give the enemies the ability to prioritize certain things over the other
     * using `priorityScores`.
     * 
     * For example: (ideas for now)
     * 
     * - In the beginning of the game the priorityScore of certain sounds are not desirable to the enemies 
     *   because they are still mapping and exploring the house.
     * 
     * - Certain objects could be very desirable or undesirable to the point that enemies would be attracted to it or 
     *   be avoiding it.
